# OpenGL-AtomSimulator

This is a mini project of computer graphics that demonstrates the simulation of an atom's structure using OpenGL.

## Features

- Simulates the structure of an atom, including the nucleus and electrons
- Allows the user to input the number of electrons in each shell
- Displays the name of the element based on the number of electrons
- Uses OpenGL for graphics rendering

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- OpenGL library
- GLUT library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bkk31/OpenGL-AtomSimulator.git
   ```

2. Build and run the program:
   ```
   cd OpenGL-AtomSimulator
   make
   ./main
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the program.
2. Press a number key (1-118) to input the atomic number.
3. The program will display the name of the element based on the number of electrons.
4. Use mouse buttons for the rotation of the electrons
